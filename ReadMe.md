Battle royale is "not your mother's trivia game". We have super hard questions and super cute ninjas... need I say more?

I'll say more.

In our app a user is able to:
   login or create an account

  (once logged in):
   chat with other players in the lobby while they choose a trivia game room.
   select a trivia game room
   enter the room with their friends and trash-talk each other mid-game.
   play a round with ten questions
   feel a rush as they try to get the right answer as fast as possible to score maximum points
   feel pangs of despair as faster (but wrong answers) take away more points
   or sit patiently, let a question roll by, neither lose nor gain any points
   see their current points at the end of a questions
   see their points relative to everyone they played with at the end of the game.
